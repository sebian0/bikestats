# bikestats
bicycle stats python program
This super simple python script will allow you to input data cell by cell into an excel sheet from the command line.
Tailor it to your needs by editing the data variables according to column names in your excel sheet, as well as the inputs.


Hopefully this will resolve some questions about openpyxl and it's uses for appending data to an existing excel sheet, a topic which is not greatly explored in the wild yet
or in the official openpyxl library documentation.
